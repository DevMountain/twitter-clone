Twitter Clone
=============

##Objective
Use jQuery to create a "clone" that mimicks how the Twitter web application functions

Use this repo as the starting point for the Twitter clone project:

![alt text](https://github.com/DevMountain/twitter-clone/blob/master/Twitter%20Clone%20Example.png?raw=true,"Twitter Clone Example")

## Part One
* Fork the repo
* Get familiar with the html/css
* Right before your closing body tag, link to your jQuery found in the js folder.
* Create a animations.js file and then link to it right before your the closing body tag
* Use jQuery to add the following features:
  * Initially, the Tweet button and the character count button should be hidden (CSS).
  * When the user clicks on the textarea, the textarea should double in size and the character count and Tweet buttons should be revealed.
  * As the user types, the character count should decrease.
  * When there are 10 or less characters, the character counter should turn red.
  * If the user puts in more than 140 characters, the tweet button should be disabled (and re-enabled when there are <= 140 chars).
  * When the user successfully inputs characters and clicks the “Tweet” button, a new tweet should be created and added to the tweet stream in the main column, using the user’s fake profile image in the top left and username/fullname.

## Part Two
* The tweet actions (Reply, Retweet, etc) should only show up when you hover over that individual tweet. Otherwise, they should be hidden.
* The Retweets/timestamp/Reply areas should also be hidden by default. These should only expand if you click on the tweet. Have the students use a jQuery animation to accomplish the reveal, similar to how it’s done on Twitter.com

## Black Diamond
* Make timestamps similar to how they look on Twitter (1h, 18m, 1m) and use the jQuery "timeago" plugin to make them automatic.
* Implement the Bootstrap tooltips for when you hover over a user’s avatar image
* Persist new tweets using local storage
* Persist new tweets using a service like parse https://parse.com/


### Here's a list of the jQuery 'Need to Knows'

Window Ready Event

* `$(function () {});`
  * also `$(document).ready(function(){});`

Selectors

* `$(".some-class") // select by classname`
* `$(this) // the element which created the event`
* `$('.some-class').find('.some-child-class');`
* `$('.some-class').closest('.some-parent-class');`
* See also <http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048>

Events

* `$('body').on('someEvent', '.some-class', function() {});`
  * <http://api.jquery.com/category/events/>
  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_events#Common.2FW3C_events>
  * click
  * keyup
  * change
  * load
  * error

Create Element

* Be cautious <https://www.box.com/blog/securing-jquery-against-unintended-xss/>
* `var $myNewElement = $('<span>Tyler McGinnis</span>')`
* `$('.some-class').html('<span>Tyler McGinnis</span>')`

Manipulate Elements

* `$('.some-class').text("my <script>-safe text");`
* `$('.some-class').val(); //input, textarea, select`
* `$('.some-class').prop('checked'); // checkbox`
* `$('.some-class').show();`
* `$('.some-class').hide();`
* `$('.some-class').prepend($myNewElement);`
* `$('.some-class').append($myNewElement);`
  * also `$myNewElement.appendTo($('.some-class'));`
* `$('.some-class').remove();`;
* `$(this).addClass('.style-class');`
* `$(this).removeClass('.style-class');`
* `$(this).toggleClass('.style-class');`
* `$('.some-class').css({}); // misnomer, actually changes 'style' attribute`
